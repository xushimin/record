## What’s a Web Cache? Why do people use them?

```
what: A Web cache sits between one or more Web servers (also known as origin servers) and a client or many clients, and watches requests come by, saving copies of the responses

```

expire: date
Cache-Control: max-age=12121  //s

这两个属性决定去不去服务器验证

E-tag: hash
Last-Modified: date

这个属性是在服务进行比对，决定要返回fresh 还是告诉客户端在缓存取
